# LP Indexer Documentation Site

This documentation site is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

Legacy project docs are archived in `../docs-archive/` for reference and migration.

## Installation

```bash
cd docs
npm install
```

## Local Development

```bash
cd docs
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
cd docs
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

```bash
cd docs
npm run deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.

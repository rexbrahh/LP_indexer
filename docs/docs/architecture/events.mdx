title: Canonical event model
---

The pipeline normalizes different DEX program activity into a stable set of canonical events.

## Source of truth: protobuf schema

The canonical event schema is defined in `proto/` and generates Go/C++ bindings into `gen/`.

```proto title="proto/dex/sol/v1/core.proto (canonical messages)" file=<rootDir>/proto/dex/sol/v1/core.proto#L7-L83 showLineNumbers
```

## Swap events

A swap event typically contains:

- `chain_id`, `slot`, `sig`, `idx` (identity / ordering)
- `program_id`, `pool_id` (DEX routing)
- base/quote mints + decimals
- in/out amounts and reserves
- flags: `provisional`, `is_undo`

### How to interpret key fields

- `slot` + `sig` + `index` form a stable identity for “one swap event within one transaction”.
- `dec_base` / `dec_quote` are required so consumers can normalize raw integer amounts into human units.
- `provisional` exists to support low-latency consumers; downstream may choose to ignore provisional rows, merge them, or treat them as “preview”.
- `is_undo` is a compensating event: consumers should treat it as reverting the effect of an earlier swap (same identity or same logical key, depending on sink semantics).

## Candle events

Candles represent OHLCV aggregations for a **pair** or **pool** over a timeframe:

- identity: `chain_id`, `pair_id` or `pool_id`, `timeframe`, `window_start`
- pricing: `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`
- totals: volume + trades
- flags: `provisional`, `is_correction`

## Provisional vs finalized

Some parts of the pipeline emit provisional data for low latency and later emit a “finalized” version. Sinks and consumers must define how they reconcile these states.

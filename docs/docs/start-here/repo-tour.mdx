## Runtime flow

The runtime services follow the ingest → decode → publish → serve flow.

The high-level module organization is captured in `AGENTS.md`:

```md title="AGENTS.md (project structure)" file=<rootDir>/AGENTS.md#L1-L5 showLineNumbers
```

Key directories:

- [`cmd/`](../reference/code/cmd) – binaries (entrypoints).
- [`ingestor/`](../reference/code/ingestor) – ingestion plumbing + the boundary where “raw chain data” becomes “decoder input.”
- [`decoder/`](../reference/code/decoder) – program-specific decoders (Raydium, Orca Whirlpools, Meteora…).
- [`sinks/`](../reference/code/sinks) – persistence consumers (ClickHouse, Parquet, NATS helpers).
- [`api/`](../reference/code/api) – serving layer (HTTP handlers, caching).
- [`bridge/`](../reference/code/bridge) – compatibility bridge for legacy subject/schema consumers.
- [`backfill/`](../reference/code/backfill) – orchestrated historical backfill tooling.

Supporting directories:

- [`proto/`](../reference/code/proto) – protobuf definitions (source of truth).
- `gen/` – generated code (do not edit by hand; see [coverage notes](../reference/coverage)).
- [`ops/`](../reference/code/ops) – operational configs: ClickHouse schemas, JetStream configs, subject maps.
- [`scripts/`](../reference/code/scripts) – automation and harnesses.
- [`observability/`](../reference/code/observability) – dashboards/telemetry artifacts.
- [`state/`](../reference/code/state) – long-running analytics engines (C++ codebases).

## Read order (suggested)

1. `README.md` (how to run + high-level goals)
2. [`cmd/ingestor/geyser/main.go`](../reference/code/cmd/ingestor/geyser/main) (how events enter the system)
3. [`ingestor/`](../reference/code/ingestor) package(s) used by the ingestor
4. [`decoder/`](../reference/code/decoder) packages (program-specific decoding)
5. [`sinks/`](../reference/code/sinks) packages (persistence and batching)

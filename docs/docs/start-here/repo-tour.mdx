## Runtime flow

The runtime services follow the ingest → decode → publish → serve flow.

The high-level module organization is captured in `AGENTS.md`:

```md title="AGENTS.md (project structure)" file=<rootDir>/AGENTS.md#L1-L5 showLineNumbers
```

Key directories:

- `cmd/` – binaries (entrypoints).
- `ingestor/` – ingestion plumbing + the boundary where “raw chain data” becomes “decoder input.”
- `decoder/` – program-specific decoders (Raydium, Orca Whirlpools, Meteora…).
- `sinks/` – persistence consumers (ClickHouse, Parquet, NATS helpers).
- `api/` – serving layer (HTTP handlers, caching).
- `bridge/` – compatibility bridge for legacy subject/schema consumers.
- `backfill/` – orchestrated historical backfill tooling.

Supporting directories:

- `proto/` – protobuf definitions (source of truth).
- `gen/` – generated code (do not edit by hand).
- `ops/` – operational configs: ClickHouse schemas, JetStream configs, subject maps.
- `scripts/` – automation and harnesses.
- `observability/` – dashboards/telemetry artifacts.
- `state/` – long-running analytics engines (C++ codebases).

## Read order (suggested)

1. `README.md` (how to run + high-level goals)
2. `cmd/ingestor/geyser/main.go` (how events enter the system)
3. `ingestor/` package(s) used by the ingestor
4. `decoder/` packages (program-specific decoding)
5. `sinks/` packages (persistence and batching)

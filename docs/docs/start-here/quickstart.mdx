title: Quickstart (local dev)
---

This guide gets you from zero to “I can run the local pipeline and validate output.”

## Prerequisites

- Docker (for local NATS + ClickHouse via `make up`)
- Go (recommended: `nix develop` provides Go 1.22)
- `nats` CLI (required by `make ops.jetstream.init`)
- For `make sink-e2e`: `clickhouse-client`, `aws` CLI, and `duckdb` CLI

## Step 1: enter the dev shell

```bash
nix develop
```

If you don’t use Nix, you can still work with system Go, but you’ll need your own toolchain management for generator CLIs.

## Step 2: start infra (NATS + ClickHouse)

```bash
make up
```

This uses `docker-compose.yml` in the repo root.

Under the hood, `make up` is just a thin wrapper over Docker Compose:

```makefile title="Makefile: local infra + JetStream bootstrap" file=<rootDir>/Makefile#L115-L162 showLineNumbers
```

## Step 3: initialize JetStream

```bash
make ops.jetstream.init
```

This creates the `DEX` stream and a default consumer using JSON configs in `ops/jetstream/`.

The exact stream definition is committed in-repo:

```json title="ops/jetstream/streams.dex.json" file=<rootDir>/ops/jetstream/streams.dex.json showLineNumbers
```

## Step 4: run a service

Example: start the Geyser ingestor:

```bash
make run.ingestor.geyser
```

In another terminal, start sinks:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sink/clickhouse
go run ./cmd/sink/parquet
```

## Step 5: run the end-to-end harness (recommended)

Use the sink E2E harness (writes sample events → validates ClickHouse rows → validates Parquet output):

```bash
make sink-e2e
```

The harness does three things:

1. Boots sinks against your local infra.
2. Replays a deterministic fixture into JetStream.
3. Validates ClickHouse + Parquet output matches the fixture.

```bash title="scripts/run_sink_e2e.sh (setup + replay)" file=<rootDir>/scripts/run_sink_e2e.sh#L1-L116 showLineNumbers
```

The default replay fixture is `fixtures/sink_sample.json`:

```json title="fixtures/sink_sample.json (excerpt)" file=<rootDir>/fixtures/sink_sample.json#L1-L120 showLineNumbers
```

If you’re iterating on candle logic specifically:

```bash
make candle-e2e
```

## Troubleshooting

- If `make ops.jetstream.init` fails, verify the `nats` CLI is installed and `NATS_URL` is reachable.
- If ClickHouse queries fail, confirm `make up` succeeded and the ClickHouse port is reachable.

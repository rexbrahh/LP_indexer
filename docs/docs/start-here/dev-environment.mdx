title: Dev environment

## Recommended: Nix

The repo is set up to work best with Nix:

```bash
nix develop
```

This should provide:

- Go 1.22
- Clang 17 (for the C++ engines)
- generator tools used by scripts / protobuf workflows

The repo’s “golden path” commands are summarized in `AGENTS.md`:

```md title="AGENTS.md (build/test quick reference)" file=<rootDir>/AGENTS.md#L6-L18 showLineNumbers
```

## Common tasks

```bash
make test
make build
make proto-gen
```

## Formatting conventions

- Go: `gofmt` (run `gofmt -w` on modified files)
- Prefer explicit `context.Context` threading, early returns, and table-driven tests.

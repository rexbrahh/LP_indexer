## Core runtime terms

**Chain**: a blockchain network. Most of the repo targets Solana (often `chain_id = 501`).

**Slot**: Solana’s monotonically increasing block height concept; used as the primary ordering axis.

**Signature (`sig`)**: transaction signature (hash) used to identify a Solana transaction.

**Program**: Solana program ID (smart contract). Decoders are program-specific.

**Pool**: DEX liquidity pool identifier (often a Solana account address).

**Provisional**: a flag indicating an event is produced before finality (useful for low-latency consumers). Some sinks may treat provisional data differently.

**Undo (`is_undo`)**: a compensating event indicating the earlier effect should be reverted.

**Candle**: aggregated OHLCV for a pair or pool over a timeframe (e.g. `1s`, `1m`), keyed by `window_start`.

## Infrastructure

**NATS JetStream**: the persistent message bus used for publishing canonical events and consuming them in sinks.

**ClickHouse**: column store used for high-throughput analytics tables.

**Parquet**: columnar file format used for batch export / data lake workflows.

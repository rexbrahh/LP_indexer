title: Deployment (GitHub Pages + services)

## Documentation site (GitHub Pages)

This repo’s docs site lives under `docs/` and is configured for GitHub Pages:

- `docs/docusaurus.config.ts` – `url` + `baseUrl`
- `npm run build` outputs `docs/build/`

## Runtime services

Deployment for runtime services is environment-specific. See `docs-archive/CICD_AND_DEPLOYMENT.md` for current runbooks until the new docs set is fully migrated.

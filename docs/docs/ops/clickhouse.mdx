## Apply schemas

```bash
make ops.clickhouse.apply
```

Schemas live in `ops/clickhouse/`.

Current note:

- `trades` is actively written by `cmd/sink/clickhouse`.
- `ohlcv_*` schemas are the intended candle analytics tables; candle materialization currently lives in `cmd/candles` and may require schema alignment depending on your deployment.

## E2E validation

```bash
make sink-e2e
```

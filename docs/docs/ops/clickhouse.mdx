## Apply schemas

```bash
make ops.clickhouse.apply
```

Schemas live in `ops/clickhouse/`.

Annotated references:

- [`ops/clickhouse/all.sql`](../reference/code/ops/clickhouse/all)
- [`ops/clickhouse/trades.sql`](../reference/code/ops/clickhouse/trades)

Current note:

- `trades` is actively written by `cmd/sink/clickhouse`.
- `ohlcv_*` schemas are the intended candle analytics tables; candle materialization currently lives in `cmd/candles` and may require schema alignment depending on your deployment.

## E2E validation

```bash
make sink-e2e
```

Harness source: [`scripts/run_sink_e2e.sh`](../reference/code/scripts/run_sink_e2e)

title: "Service: sinks"
---

Sinks consume canonical JetStream events and persist them to storage backends.

## Entrypoints

- `cmd/sink/clickhouse/main.go`
- `cmd/sink/parquet/main.go`
  - Note: the ClickHouse sink currently consumes swap/trade subjects; candle materialization is handled by `cmd/candles`.

## Entrypoints (wiring)

Both sink binaries follow the same structure:

1. Load a service config from environment variables.
2. Construct a long-running service object.
3. Install SIGINT/SIGTERM handling to cancel the context.
4. Call `Run(ctx)` and exit on error.

```go title="cmd/sink/parquet/main.go" file=<rootDir>/cmd/sink/parquet/main.go showLineNumbers
```

## Validation harness

```bash
make sink-e2e
```

The API layer serves persisted data to downstream clients.

## Where code lives

- `api/http/` – HTTP server and handlers

## Current entrypoint

The API currently ships as a `main` package under `api/http/`:

```bash
go run ./api/http
```

```go title="api/http/main.go" file=<rootDir>/api/http/main.go showLineNumbers
```

## Typical dependencies

- ClickHouse (source of truth for analytical queries)
- Redis (hot cache / windowed data)

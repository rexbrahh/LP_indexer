title: "Service: backfill"
---

Backfill tooling replays historical data through the same canonical pipeline to populate sinks deterministically.

## Where code lives

- [`backfill/`](../reference/code/backfill) – orchestrator + helpers

## Goal

Reproduce the same persisted state you would get from live ingestion, with deterministic IDs and idempotent sinks.

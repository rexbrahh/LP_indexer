title: "Service: ingestor"
---

The ingestor connects to a chain data source and publishes canonical events into JetStream.

## Entrypoints

- `cmd/ingestor/geyser/main.go`
- `cmd/ingestor/geyser-demo/main.go`

## What the entrypoint does (wiring)

The Geyser ingestor binary is intentionally thin: it loads config from env/files, chooses which service implementation to run (normal vs. failover), installs shutdown handling, and then calls `Run`.

```go title="cmd/ingestor/geyser/main.go" file=<rootDir>/cmd/ingestor/geyser/main.go showLineNumbers
```

## Primary responsibilities

1. Connect to data source.
2. Filter relevant programs/accounts.
3. Decode or delegate decode.
4. Publish canonical events to JetStream subjects.

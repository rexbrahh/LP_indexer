Decoders translate program-specific transactions and account updates into canonical events.

## Where code lives

- [`decoder/`](../reference/code/decoder) – DEX-specific logic and helpers
- [`ingestor/decoder/`](../reference/code/ingestor/decoder/) – integration boundary between ingestor updates and decoder output

Schema contract:

- [`message SwapEvent`](../reference/code/proto/dex/sol/v1/core#message-swapevent)

## Primary responsibilities

- Interpret instruction data.
- Track pool metadata needed for decoding.
- Emit canonical swap events (and any higher-order derived data).

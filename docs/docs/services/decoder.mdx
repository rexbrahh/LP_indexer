title: "Service: decoder"
---

Decoders translate program-specific transactions and account updates into canonical events.

## Where code lives

- `decoder/` – DEX-specific logic and helpers
- `ingestor/decoder/` – integration boundary between ingestor updates and decoder output

## Primary responsibilities

- Interpret instruction data.
- Track pool metadata needed for decoding.
- Emit canonical swap events (and any higher-order derived data).

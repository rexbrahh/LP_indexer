title: "Service: bridge"
---

The bridge exists to keep legacy consumers working while the new pipeline is rolled out.

## Entrypoint

- `cmd/bridge/main.go`

## Entrypoint (wiring)

The bridge binary is thin glue around the `bridge` package:

```go title="cmd/bridge/main.go" file=<rootDir>/cmd/bridge/main.go showLineNumbers
```

## When to use

- During cutover phases where downstream still reads legacy subjects/schemas.

title: Documentation coverage
---

This page tracks **annotated-source coverage** for the core runtime Go code and documents the conventions used to keep it maintainable.

## Coverage goal

For each “core” Go file (see scope below), we want:

1. A **full-source** view with line numbers.
2. A **declaration-by-declaration walkthrough** explaining:
   - what it is
   - how it works
   - why it exists

The code excerpts are imported at build time with `remark-code-import`, so the docs always reflect the current repo state.

## Scope (current)

The generator (`scripts/docs/generate_go_code_reference.go`) scans these directories by default:

- `cmd/`
- `ingestor/`
- `decoder/`
- `sinks/`
- `api/`
- `bridge/`
- `backfill/`

Notes:

- `*_test.go` files are intentionally excluded by default.
- Generated outputs (e.g. `gen/`) should not be hand-edited and are not part of the annotated-source scope.

## Current status

As of the current repo snapshot, all non-test Go files under the scope directories above have an annotated page under:

- `docs/docs/reference/code/**`

Quick sanity checks:

```bash
rg -n "_TODO_" docs/docs/reference/code -S
cd docs && npm run build
```

## How to maintain annotated-source docs

### Add new pages when code is added

When a new `.go` file lands under one of the scoped directories:

1. Generate the MDX skeleton page (non-destructive by default):

```bash
go run ./scripts/docs/generate_go_code_reference.go
```

2. Fill in:
   - `## What this file is`
   - `## Why this file exists`
   - every `**What/How/Why:** _TODO_` block

### Keep code excerpts stable and readable

- Prefer importing **full files** for scanning and **small line ranges** for declaration-level walkthroughs (the generator does this automatically).
- When refactors shift line numbers, update `#Lx-Ly` ranges so each excerpt still matches the heading it’s documented under.
- Keep heading text MDX-safe:
  - Avoid putting full Go signatures in headings (e.g. channel types can be mis-parsed as JSX). The generator already uses `func (*T) Name` titles for this reason.

### Conventions used in code reference pages

- Use `showLineNumbers` for all imported snippets.
- Keep the `What / How / Why` format consistent so readers can skim quickly.
- Write “Why” in architectural terms (boundaries, invariants, and failure modes), not just restating the code.

### Avoid overwriting manual annotations

The generator **skips existing MDX files** unless you pass `-overwrite`.

Only use `-overwrite` when you explicitly want to regenerate pages and are OK with losing manual edits:

```bash
go run ./scripts/docs/generate_go_code_reference.go -overwrite
```

title: Code reference
---

This section contains the **annotated source** for core runtime files.

## Goal

For each core file we aim to provide:

1. The full source (with line numbers) for quick scanning.
2. A declaration-by-declaration walkthrough explaining:
   - what it is
   - how it works
   - why it exists in the architecture

## How to use this section

- Start with `cmd/**` entrypoints to understand processes and wiring.
- Then follow links to the packages those binaries import.

## Keeping code blocks in sync

Code blocks on these pages are populated at build time using `remark-code-import` (see `docs/docusaurus.config.ts`). The docs use the `<rootDir>` shortcut to reference files from the git repo root:

````md
```go file=<rootDir>/cmd/ingestor/geyser/main.go
```
````

## Generating skeleton pages

Most pages under this section were generated by:

```bash
go run ./scripts/docs/generate_go_code_reference.go
```

The generator creates a per-file scaffold with:

- a full-source code block
- a declaration-by-declaration list of code excerpts to annotate

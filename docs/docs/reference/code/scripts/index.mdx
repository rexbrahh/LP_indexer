title: "scripts/"

This section documents the repo’s **automation and validation scripts** under `scripts/`.

## What this directory is

These scripts are the glue between local developer workflows and the repo’s runtime components:

- applying ClickHouse schemas
- validating JetStream streams/consumers
- running end-to-end (E2E) harnesses for sinks and candle publishing
- building the C++ candle engine module

## How to use this section

Recommended reading order:

1. ClickHouse schema application: `apply_clickhouse_schema.sh`
2. JetStream inspection: `jetstream-validate.sh`
3. Sink E2E harness: `run_sink_e2e.sh`
4. Candle E2E harness + perf harness: `run_candle_e2e.sh`, `measure_candle_perf.sh`
5. Convenience checks: `check_bridge_metrics.sh`, `check_candle_parity.sh`

Notes:

- Most scripts assume `bash` and standard CLI tooling (`jq`, `python3`, etc.).
- When `clickhouse-client` isn’t available, some scripts can fall back to `docker exec` into a running ClickHouse container.

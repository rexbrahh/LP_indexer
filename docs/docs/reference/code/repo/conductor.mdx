title: "conductor.json"
---

This page is an **annotated source reference**. Code blocks are imported from the repository at build time.

## What this file is

`conductor.json` is a lightweight configuration file for the repo’s `.conductor/` integration.

## Why this file exists

Some developer environments use external orchestration tooling to standardize “setup” and “run” entrypoints across projects. This file is kept in the repo so those commands can be discovered and versioned.

## Full source

```json title="conductor.json" file=<rootDir>/conductor.json showLineNumbers
```

## Walkthrough

### scripts

```json title="scripts" file=<rootDir>/conductor.json#L1-L6 showLineNumbers
```

**What:** Defines `setup` and `run` script placeholders.

**How:** Both are currently empty strings, meaning this repo does not rely on conductor scripts as a primary workflow.

**Why:** Keeping the keys present allows the project to opt into conductor workflows later without reintroducing the file structure.

title: "go.mod"
---

This page is an **annotated source reference**. Code blocks are imported from the repository at build time.

## What this file is

`go.mod` defines the Go module identity, Go language version, and the dependency graph roots for the repository.

## Why this file exists

Go’s module system uses `go.mod` to make builds reproducible:

- the `module` path is the canonical import root
- the `go` directive pins the language/toolchain expectations
- the `require` blocks define direct and indirect dependencies

## Full source

```go title="go.mod" file=<rootDir>/go.mod showLineNumbers
```

## Walkthrough (by section)

### module + Go version

```go title="module + Go version" file=<rootDir>/go.mod#L1-L3 showLineNumbers
```

**What:** Declares the module path and target Go version.

**How:** The `module` line defines import paths (e.g. `github.com/rexbrahh/lp-indexer/decoder/...`). The `go` line indicates the minimum/expected Go version.

**Why:** Keeping the module path stable avoids import churn, and aligning the Go version with dev tooling (e.g. Nix) reduces “version mismatch” surprises.

### direct dependencies

```go title="direct dependencies" file=<rootDir>/go.mod#L5-L20 showLineNumbers
```

**What:** Lists libraries this repo imports directly.

**How:** Each entry is a semantic/versioned requirement, including:

- ClickHouse client (`github.com/ClickHouse/ch-go`)
- NATS server/client libraries (`github.com/nats-io/...`)
- Parquet writer (`github.com/parquet-go/parquet-go`)
- metrics (`github.com/prometheus/client_golang`)
- Solana geyser client examples (`github.com/rpcpool/yellowstone-grpc/examples/golang`)

**Why:** These “roots” define the dependency graph. Reviewing this list is a quick way to understand the repo’s external integrations.

### indirect dependencies

```go title="indirect dependencies" file=<rootDir>/go.mod#L22-L64 showLineNumbers
```

**What:** Lists transitive dependencies pulled in by the direct ones.

**How:** The Go toolchain marks these as `// indirect` when they’re not imported directly by repo packages, but are still required for builds.

**Why:** Keeping indirect deps explicit makes builds deterministic and helps tooling (like `go mod tidy`) converge on a stable module graph.

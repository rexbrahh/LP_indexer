title: "buf.work.yaml"

This page is an **annotated source reference**. Code blocks are imported from the repository at build time.

## What this file is

`buf.work.yaml` defines the Buf workspace for the repository.

## Why this file exists

Workspaces make it explicit which directories contain Buf modules and keep generation and linting pointed at the canonical `.proto` tree.

## Full source

```yaml title="buf.work.yaml" file=<rootDir>/buf.work.yaml showLineNumbers
```

## Walkthrough

### version + directories

```yaml title="version + directories" file=<rootDir>/buf.work.yaml#L1-L4 showLineNumbers
```

**What:** Declares a single-directory Buf workspace rooted at `proto/`.

**How:** Buf treats `proto/` as the module directory for schema operations (lint/breaking/generate).

**Why:** Keeping schema roots explicit reduces ambiguity and avoids accidentally generating from the wrong path.

title: "state/candle_cpp/tests"

This section documents the **GoogleTest suite** for the C++ candle engine.

## What this directory is

The files under `state/candle_cpp/tests/` validate:

- fixed-point arithmetic correctness and edge cases
- publisher dispatch behavior (dependency injection)
- candle finalization logic and worker emission behavior

## Why these tests exist

The candle engine’s correctness depends on invariants that are easy to regress during performance-focused refactors:

- arithmetic must be deterministic and overflow-safe
- windowing must bucket timestamps consistently
- finalized vs provisional candle transitions must behave predictably

These tests act as executable documentation for those invariants.

## Suggested reading order

1. `fixed_point_test.cpp` (math primitives)
2. `publisher_dispatch_test.cpp` (publisher injection and emit path)
3. `candle_finalize_test.cpp` (finalization rules and worker emission)

This directory contains ClickHouse DDL used by sinks and analytics queries.

## How to read

- Start with `trades.sql` (core swap persistence table).
- Then read `pool_snapshots.sql` and the `ohlcv_*` tables (candle persistence tables).
- `all.sql` is a monolithic schema file used by some scripts for convenience.

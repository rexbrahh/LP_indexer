title: "ops/"
---

This section documents **operational artifacts** under `ops/` (schemas, stream definitions, program lists).

## What this directory is

The runtime services rely on external systems (ClickHouse, NATS/JetStream, Geyser/RPC filters).
The `ops/` directory contains version-controlled configuration used to:

- create/validate JetStream streams and consumers
- create ClickHouse tables for sinks and analytics
- define program ID lists for ingestion filters
- define bridge subject mapping rules

## How to read

- Start with `ops/jetstream/*` to understand the message bus surfaces.
- Then read `ops/clickhouse/*` to understand persistent schema contracts.
- Finally, review `ops/programs.yaml` and `ops/bridge/subject_map.yaml` for ingestion/bridge configuration.

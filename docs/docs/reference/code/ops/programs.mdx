## What this file is

`ops/programs.yaml` is a curated list of Solana program IDs used for DEX filtering.

## Why this file exists

Ingestion pipelines often need an explicit allowlist of program IDs to:

- reduce bandwidth/compute by filtering irrelevant transactions
- make supported DEX coverage explicit and auditable
- keep IDs in version control (reviewable changes)

## Full source

```yaml title="ops/programs.yaml" file=<rootDir>/ops/programs.yaml showLineNumbers
```

## Walkthrough (by section)

### programs map

```yaml title="programs map" file=<rootDir>/ops/programs.yaml#L1-L21 showLineNumbers
```

**What:** A mapping from a human-friendly label to a Solana program ID (base58 string).

**How:** Each entry under `programs:` represents one on-chain program the ingestor/decoder cares about (Raydium, Orca, Meteora, …).

**Why:** Separating “which programs do we care about?” from code makes it easier to update program IDs (or add new ones) without refactoring ingestion logic.

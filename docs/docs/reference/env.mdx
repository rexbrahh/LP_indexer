title: Environment variables
---

This page is a living index of runtime environment variables by component.

## Quick pointers

- Ingestor defaults and flags: `make run.ingestor.geyser` in `Makefile`
- Sink defaults and flags: `scripts/run_sink_e2e.sh` and `cmd/sink/*/main.go`
- Bridge defaults and flags: `make run.bridge` in `Makefile`

As the annotated-source docs are completed, each service’s page links back to the env var definitions in code.

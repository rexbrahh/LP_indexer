This page is a living index of runtime environment variables by component.

## Quick pointers

- Ingestor defaults and flags:
  - `make run.ingestor.geyser` in [`Makefile`](./code/repo/makefile)
  - [`cmd/ingestor/geyser/main.go`](./code/cmd/ingestor/geyser/main)
- Sink defaults and flags:
  - [`scripts/run_sink_e2e.sh`](./code/scripts/run_sink_e2e)
  - [`cmd/sink/clickhouse/main.go`](./code/cmd/sink/clickhouse/main)
  - [`cmd/sink/parquet/main.go`](./code/cmd/sink/parquet/main)
- Bridge defaults and flags:
  - `make run.bridge` in [`Makefile`](./code/repo/makefile)
  - [`cmd/bridge/main.go`](./code/cmd/bridge/main)

As the annotated-source docs are completed, each service’s page links back to the env var definitions in code.
